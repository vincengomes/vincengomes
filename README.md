- 👋 Hi, I’m @vincengomes
- 🖥 I'm a hobbyist programmer which means i ask computers to do things and sometimes they actually listen!
- 🏗 All my projects are for my own amusement, so they're a wild mix that doesn't stick to any one niche.
- 👀 My main interests are Python and web development.
- 🌱 I've dabbled with Django and jamstack, and now I’m currently learning the quirks of ReactJS
